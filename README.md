# BreakoutGameJS
17/20: HTML5 Canvas API - 20 VanillaJS Projects

This app is a game where you control a paddle with arrow keys to bounce a ball up to break bricks.  This app uses the HTML5 canvas element and API.

The project will draw elements on a canvas, using the canvas paths to draw shapes.  It will add animation with requestAnimationFrame methods.
In the game you move the paddle on pressing the arrow keys, with a collision detector, keeping score and a rules button with slider.

This is the 17th project in Brad Traversy's 20 Web Projects with Vanilla JavaScript course on Udemy.com.

I am working through this project to revise concepts from B.Traversy's Modern JavaScript course, which I completed, and then to practice refactoring code using the React framework.
